Classification
Ego Vehicle is Moving ? 2 Frames
This is important for the ego vehicle to know if it understands the correlation of camera movement with ego-speed and ego-movement.
Is the vehicle properly oriented towards the lane ? 1 Frame
Is the vehicle on the correct lane ? After noisy vehicle dataset.
Is the lead vehicle closer than 10 meters ?
Is there a pedestrian crossing the road that is within 10 meters on the vehicle FOV ?
Is affected by traffic light?
Regression
Ego Speed ? 2 Frame
Knowing the speed is important, we know that already
Relative Angle. 1 Frame
Relative angle with respect to the closest waypoint.
Problems
The closest waypoint might not be a next waypoint
Distance to the center of the road.
Again the closest waypoint is wrong.
It is probably not being considered inside an intersection.
The distribution is wrong.
Distance to front vehicle (lead vehicle)
The one that we are using is fine I think.
Distance to the closest pedestrian.
Distance to the traffic light.
